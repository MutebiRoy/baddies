 Frontend:
ReactJS: This is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. React's component-based architecture makes it ideal for this kind of complex application.
React Native: For the mobile app, React Native allows you to maintain a single codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, which simplifies development and maintenance.
Redux: This is a state management library that works well with React, making it easier to manage the state across the app, especially in complex applications with multiple components needing access to the same state.
2. Backend:
Node.js with Express: Node.js is lightweight and efficient, particularly well-suited for applications that require a persistent connection from the browser back to the server. Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
MongoDB: As a NoSQL database, MongoDB is excellent for handling large volumes of data that does not have a fixed schema, making it a good choice for a social media application where different types of data and interactions need to be stored.
3. Video and Image Handling:
FFmpeg: For video processing, FFmpeg is a powerful tool that can handle almost any video and audio processing, whether it's converting formats, resizing, or compressing.
Cloudinary: This is a cloud-based service that offers solutions to your image and video management needs. It can handle uploads, storage, manipulations, optimizations, and delivery, which can scale as your user base grows.
4. Payments Integration:
Stripe or PayPal: Both platforms offer robust APIs to handle payments securely and are widely used across many e-commerce and online platforms. They support a variety of payment methods which is vital for a platform operating potentially globally.
5. Authentication:
Auth0 or Firebase Authentication: These services provide comprehensive authentication capabilities, which can handle everything from basic email and password login to social login and multi-factor authentication.
6. Hosting/Infrastructure:
AWS or Google Cloud: Both offer a comprehensive set of cloud computing services. Services like Amazon S3 for storage, EC2 for computing, or Google's equivalent (Google Cloud Storage and Google Compute Engine) would be essential. Use Elastic Load Balancer or Google Cloud Load Balancing to manage the load during peak usage times.
Docker and Kubernetes: These tools help with containerization and orchestration, making your application scalable and resilient to failures.
7. Analytics and Monitoring:
Google Analytics and Mixpanel: To track user engagement and other metrics which help in making data-driven decisions.
Sentry for real-time error tracking and New Relic for performance monitoring.
